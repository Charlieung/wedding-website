        desc: "Like all modern fairytales, we first discovered each other on Coffee Meets Bagel. After a week of banter over the phone, we met in a tiny dimly lit dive: two people, having only impressions of each other off 5 pictures and 3 paragraphs of text. Maybe it was her cute poses and aggressively bubbly love for artsy fartsy things, or maybe it was his smart charm and flirty comments â€“ no matter the reason, the connection we found started our journey"

        desc: "In our three years together, our sense of adventure took us from the cozy parks of upper east side, onto the train from Busan, over the foggy bridges of London, and surfing the waves of Hawaii. With months in the planning for the perfect moment, I caught her off guard during a beach getaway. While there was some convincing before she would go on a sunset stroll (thanks @whitney), we made her walk worth it when I got down on one knee."

        desc: "2020 was a tough time for everyone - we weren't able to see loved ones, traveling was risky, and all of our cushions developed memory foam. One Saturday morning, Erica rolled over and said, 'We have to get a puppy'. It was months of convincing before I said OK, which became one of the best decisions of my life. It was the silver lining throughout the pandemic. Both of our families could not have been more welcoming (spoiling) to their new grandchild!"
